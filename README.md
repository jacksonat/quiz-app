# quiz-app
A multiple choice quiz for iOS in Swift 2.2

This project follows a tutorial. The purpose is to learn more sophisticated data structures for handling the quiz data files. 

The data files will be written in JSON. Initially they will be stored within the app. Later they will be moved to a server from where they will be downloaded.

The app will support portrait and landscape orientation.
